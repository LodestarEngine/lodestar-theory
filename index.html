                    **Theory of Lodestar**
                        Hamza El-Kebir

In the articles linked below, the theory used by Lodestar's many
components is described. The goal is for the interested user to gain
a deeper understanding of the way in which Lodestar operates, with the
hope that Lodestar becomes less of a black box system. Ultimately, we 
want users to be able to use Lodestar with confidence, which can only
truly happen if users are familiar with the theory underpinning the code
that they are using, and any shortcomings thereof.
